"My great-grand-niece, Arabelle, will celebrate her tenth nameday in two days' time," she says. "For this momentous occasion, I wish to provide her a gift—but in my old age, I am quite unable to make the journey myself."

purchase a toy for Arabelle at Blinsky Toys in Vallaki—Blinsky’s, she notes fondly, are Arabelle’s favorites—and deliver the toy to the Vistani encampment to the southwest of Vallaki by noon on Arabelle’s nameday. She adds that the players are welcome to keep any change as payment for their efforts.
