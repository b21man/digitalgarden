- they found a windmill, inside were 3 old ladys, Morgantha and her two daughters Bella and Ofelia, they offered short stay, and angered Enya due to Morgantha resiting intimidation. 
- they chatted for a bit, but left after buying a few fresh pies. 
- They travelled into the valley, the woods below breaking into a clearing far away, a walled town standing south of a giant grey lake, beyond the lake stood a snowy mountain.
- 2 more hours they travelled, almost picking up ravens as they went. 
- Apa saw a figure moving in the treeline with them
- Ireena wanted to go check out the lake and proclaimed it was the same as in her dreams. once they got back to the path the ravens had trippled. 
- suddenly a man burst from the underbrush, clutching his arm telling the party to run, somthing was after him. 
- Enya saw through his lies and ordered Azurite to throw a javelin. 
- the javelin pierced the man, and as they approached his gurgles became laughter, as he transformed into a giant werwolf. snapped the javelin and said 'shame, its more fun when they run.'

#### recap 
The morning began in the quiet ashes of a campfire. Stanmir greeted the party with a warning: _Do not disturb Madam Eva._ Lily did anyway, finding her asleep on a pallet, and—perhaps wisely—left her be.

South they traveled, catching a glimpse of an undead rider through the mist. As fog parted, a lonely watchtower emerged. Within, they uncovered a cold silver amulet bearing a dragon’s sigil, two graves, a dead wolf, and a magical noose—discovered when it wrapped itself around Apa’s hand.

Wolves stalked them soon after. In an ambush gone sideways, one lunged Lily off a ravine. Thinking fast, Apa tossed the rope and shouted, “Noosed!”—snagging her neck, saving her from the fall but choking her breath. She gasped out “uncoil,” barely escaping death, then climbed back up. Kaelin transformed into a dire wolf, tearing into the attackers. The survivors fled.

They continued, crossing a bridge beneath Tser Falls, where a revenant barred the way. Claiming allegiance to Strahd failed when they learned he served the Order of the Silver Dragon. He warned them: seek Argynvostholt and Sir Godfrey.

Further along, they met the hags of Old Bonegrinder, who offered rest and pies—but stirred Enya’s wrath. Declining the offer, they pressed on toward Vallaki.

Near the lake Ireena saw in her dreams, the ravens grew in number. A man burst from the trees, wounded, begging for help. But Enya saw through the ruse. Azurite’s javelin struck true—only for the man to rise laughing, transforming into a massive werewolf:  
“_Shame… it’s more fun when they run._”
