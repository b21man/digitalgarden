#### recap 
The session opened in the Blood of the Vine Tavern, with Ismark pleading for the party to treat Strahd as the threat he is. Instead, they plotted rebellion—mirroring Dorus’ revolution—seeking to raise an army from Barovia’s villagers.

Enya magically swayed Ismark to give them names: Alenka, Parriwimple, Renny, Dimitri, Sasha. On their way to the Burgomaster’s mansion, they helped an old woman—Morgantha—unstick her cart, unknowingly purchasing her entire stock of dream pies.

At the mansion, a hostile mob demanded Ireena be handed over for sacrifice. Enya’s infernal rage scattered them. Silas learned the pies held eerie sway over the townsfolk.

Inside, Azurite healed the wounded Burgomaster, and the group shared rabbit stew and lore. Why, the man wondered, do the undead attack in trickles when they swarm the forests?

The party asked Ireena to join them; the Burgomaster agreed—if she was brought safely to Vallaki first.

Later, they ate the pies. One by one, all but Enya fell into enchanted sleep—dreaming of love, family, heists, and warmth.

Enya faced a furious Ismark, who accused her of sorcery, but Ireena defused the confrontation. Enya shopped (and bought a net), then returned to awaken her friends.

At the palisade, they built a barricade just in time. Waves of zombies attacked. Villagers fought alongside them. Ghouls rushed in, one devouring a man. Two bloated undead breached the lines—one exploded, killing Silas. Apa barely revived him.

The final creature fell to Haera’s arrow—its body bursting in death. A raven beckoned them to the town square, where Ismark stood alone among corpses.

One final giant zombie loomed.

# Session Overview
Session began back in the blood of the vine tavern. Ismark was pleading with the players to take Stradh as a serious threat.  however the players decided to build an army from the towns people of barovia mirroring that of Dorus rebellion. 

Enya cast friends on Ismark, and got him to give them directions to the burgomasters mansion and get names from him of who may be good fighters to take with them to the castle. He told them to take; Alenka, Parriwimple, Renny, Dimtri, Sasha.

They left him on way to the burgomasters mansion, on way they stumbled into an old woman, who they later learned was named Morgantha. they helped her unstuck her cart and bought all of her pies for 1gp. she praised them for how generous they are and squeaked her trolly down the rest of the street. 

They made it to the mansion to find a small angry mob had formed, demanding the burgomaster to hand over Ireena so they could sacrifice her to the Devil stradh. Silas found that the pies had great meaning to the common folk of barovia as they almost hungrily fought to pie the pie off him. Enya meanwhile began to smoulder, her eyes becoming deep pits of hellfire. Melissa the ring leader of the mob, backed up, and the crowd quickly dispersed. 

Azurite healed the Burgomaster, and the party where invited in for lunch. They all enjoyed some rabbit stew whilst Ireena took interest in some of the characters backstories. The burgomaster proposed a dilema, why if hundreds of undead crowd the forests around the village, do only a few get sent to attack each night. The players pondered the question. 

After the lunch, the players expressed the interest in ireena coming along on there adventure to kill stradh. the burgomaster agreed, but on the one condition that the  players leave her in Valaki before attempting to kill the devil. Upon the plan being made, the man wrote the players a letter. 

Setting off to start defending the palisade, they saw Ismark storming down the road, they all decided to eat the pies at this point, knocking out all but Enya.
Azurite dreamed of a picnic with Lily. 
Lily dreamed of nature.
Silas dreamed of a perfect heist. 
Haera dreamed of her sister.
Apa dreamed of a warm fire and a well cooked dinner. 

meanwhile Ismark confronted Enya, shouting at her about bewitching him. Luckily Ireena was there to smooth over the confrontation. 

Enya decided to leave the others dreaming and go shopping. Though Bildrath mercantile didn't seem to have anything of interest. She did however buy a net. 

Coming back to the mansion she woke up the others, waves of sadness washed over them as they dried off by the fireplace. Once it hit 5pm they made there way over to the palisade and began preparing for the invasion. 

They were able to set up a barricade spanning the width of the houses just before the zombies began to attack. 

The first few waves the zombies just kept coming, shambling towards the barricade and slamming it, attempting to break the players defences. Once they were successful 6 ghouls sprinted out of the treeline, 3 were obliterated by a giant beam of moonlight cast by Lily. The villagers sent to help the players peppered the ghouls and zombies with arrows best they could, Enya was able to burn the undead, Azurite on the front lines kept the zombies from reaching the spellcasters. 2 ugly pulsating zombies stumbled from the treeline, a thick acrid miasma surrounding each beast. 

They made it through the players defences, and as the players thought they had a handle on the situation one of them exploded. Killing Silas, who up until this point had been dodging in and out of cover, delivering lethal bows with his quarterstaff. Seeing his friend fall Apa was able to channel magic to restore some of his vitality. 


Meanwhile the ghouls had made it to the villagers, one ghoul was seen eating the villager. in shock the other ran away. 

Once the ghoul was killed there was only the other bloated pustulating corpse, creeping closer to the gate.  Haera, drew back on her bow, unleashing an arrow that flew through the foul creatures head. it fell forward, and on impact of the floor the creatures body burst into puss and blood. 

Enya spotted a blue tipped raven frantically motioning the others to follow it. Running through the city the party followed the raven to the burgomasters square. there they found Ismark surrounded by dead defenders. Children, women and the elderly coward behind tents and debris. 

One of the giant zombies had breached the walls. And stumbles towards the villagers.
