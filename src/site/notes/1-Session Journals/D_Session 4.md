#### Recap 
The session began in the _Death House's_ basement, where the party fled through its collapsing dungeons after defeating Walter. They encountered a soldier, Bog, battling ghouls and aided him before hearing screams from above. Kaelin and Haera rushed upstairs, where Lady Durst's spirit was dragging the ghosts of the children. Combat ensued, splitting the party as others explored for exits in the dungeons, with Azurite suffering injuries from spinning staircases.

The attic group fought Lady Durst, who incapacitated Enya and targeted Silas after he retrieved the children’s bones. Despite the party’s attempts to escape, the house itself became hostile, gnashing its doors like jaws. Azurite, Kaelin, Bog, and Apa narrowly escaped as the house collapsed.

Outside, they found themselves in an unfamiliar courtyard surrounded by towering pines. Seeking refuge in a nearby tower, they rested despite eerie noises during the night. By morning, Silas scouted the land, spotting a town beyond an ancient wall and a looming gothic castle.

Traveling east, the party reached the village, noticing its makeshift defenses and the ominous castle above. They were greeted by Ismark, who led them to the _Blood of the Vine Tavern_. There, Ismark revealed the devil Strahd’s resurgence and a failed rebellion led by a priest’s son. Tensions rose between Azurite and Ismark over the villagers' plight. Meanwhile, Enya observed a sobbing woman outside lamenting her missing daughter, Gertruda.

# Session Overview

Session started in the basement of the death house.
Players bashed through the gate of the reliquary after defeating Walter, they Ran up into the lower dungeons, shadowed ghouls to there right meant they were forced to jump over the growing chasm in the ground. Luckily everyone made it across ok. 
There they found a human soldier fighting off 3 ghouls, quickly jumping to aid they found his name was Bog. After pleasantries were shared they heard a scream from up above. 
Kaelin and Haera has left the two children upstairs trying to find where the others had gotten too. hearing the scream however, they decided to start back upstairs to the attic. 
There they, and some other party members saw Lady Durst's malformed spirits dragging the spirits of the kids. Jumping to help they engaged her in combat. 
4 members, Haera, Azruite, Lily, Silas still lay in the dungeons depths frantically looking for an alternative way out. unfortunately they found only straw mattresses and bones. 
attempting to rejoin the others they started up the spiral staircase, but it began to spin faster and faster, only Azurite lost his balance, flung into the wall where nails emerged and scraped across his armour. slowly he was able to drag him self to the top of the stairs. 
Meanwhile, Enya, Apa, Bog, Kaelin fought with the ghastly visage. 
It let out a blood curdling scream rendering Enya instantly unconscious. 
The others now in the attic hallway began to help, Silas slipped into the kids room, packed up there bones and as he attempted to sneak back out the lady spotted him. "YOU SHALL NOT HAVE MY CHILDREN" She screamed as she reached for Silas, cold filled his bones and his eyes began to haze, but not before throwing the bag of bones out the door. 
Kaelin was able to distract the Lady durst, shadow boxing the misty tendrils as the others began to flee the crumbling house. 
Just as they thought they were rid of Elizabeth, she began to materialize through the wall. 
As this was happening, apa spiraled down the stairs in his shell, a sure way to get down. But as he hit the bottom floor, a familiar yellow eye watched him. It was one of the stuffed wolves they had failed to destroy in the hunting room. 
One by one the others began fleeing down the stairs, Bog with the bag of bones. 
Apa and bog fought the stuffed wolf, and just as they thought it might take one of there lifes, the entire house shook. They heard a crash from upstairs as 15 stone of steel dropped onto the wolf. Azurite had just fallen 4 stories onto the wolf. Kaelin spotting his time jumped down after him. 
No time for celebration as the ghostly blue light from Lady Durst began to follow them down the stair case. 
They made for the front door, but the door was malformed, sharp wooden teeth jutted from the door way, thousands of nails like little teeth poked from the splinters. the door gnashed like a mouth of a great beast. 
Stuck between a rock and a hard place Bog, then Apa decided to jump through the mouth, Bog landed gracefully as Apa got caught in the houses maw, falling unconscious. 
Azurite, looking for a way to stop the gnashing threw a block of plaster and wood, splintering the row of jutted planks, and in turn slowing the ferocity of the manors jaw. 
They managed to successfully jump through, just as the entire house began to collapse behind them. 

The confines of the courtyard is where there familiarity stopped. surrounding them were great pines instead of oaks. the half moon glowed through thick grey clouds illuminating a tower in the distance. rugged and tired, they trooped towards the tower in hopes for safety. 
Luckily they found safety in the old creaking stone building. creating a fire and barricading the door with Azurites body, they laid down to rest. Only being disturbed by a quiet scrabbling at the door during the night. 

In the morning, Silas climbed a tree to get a lay of the land, he saw a large wall spanning a valley to the east, a town lay several miles beyond the wall shadowed by a cliff-face and a giant castle with swirling dark clouds covering the spire. To the west lay a thick blanket of mist, almost like a dome spreading as far as he could see north, and south. 

They decided to make there way towards east. After an hour or so, they came across the giant ancient wall, 60ft or so high with a gate equally as massive, around 30ft high. they opened it easily enough, after Kaelin attempted to kick it without checking if the door was locked or not. On ward they travelled, the giant gate closing behind them, deciding not to investigate the scent of decay coming from off the wooded path. 

Finally they reached the edge of the thick woods. they finally could see the town in more detail, seeing the wooden palisade surrounding the town made from makeshift items, tables, doors, etc. On the cliff behind the village, stood a great gothic castle. as they gaped in awe lighting struck illuminating the intricate spires. 

Making there way towards the village they were halted by a couple of posted guardsmen. But the situation was quickly diffused by Ismark. who introduced himself to the party. 

He led them through the village, gaunt faced peasants watched them walk through the town, as a peculiar blue tipped raven hopped from building to building, watching them almost. 

They passed through a second inner wall, into a town square, where the statue of Ismarks great grandfather, Ismark the great, stood, sword raised towards raven loft. He beckoned them through the square and into a rundown tavern named Blood of the vine tavern. There he got 8 pints for the party from the barkeep Arik. 

He then explained that the devil Stradh had awakened 3 months ago following a rebellion raised by the priests son Doru. he led 30 or so villagers into the castle raven loft but they were never seen again. The party had some questions, that Ismark answered the best he could. mid conversation a bedraggled balding man slammed the table causing quite a scene.

He explained how his sister, and her husband had died in the latest raid, how Ismark had convinced the villagers to stay put and fight, and how many had died in the coming nights. He spat on Ismarks 'the lesser', mocking him for his actions. He walked out, anger still clear on his face. 

The party tried to convince Ismark to send all of his fighting men to the castle to kill Stradh tonight. He laughed, one can not simply kill Stradh. He is the devil, this land is his creation, he controls the wolves, the crows, everything. 

At the mention of crows, Enya stepped outside to see if she could still spot the Blue tipped raven. but it had vanished, what she did see however was Bildrath holding a sobbing woman, crying about her daughter Gertruda. She had disapeared in the night. Bildrath told her softly to give up. "Gertrudas gone Mary . I'm so sorry."

stepping back into the tavern the conversation between Azurite and Ismark became heated, Azurite told him he was the cause of the villagers death. But Ismark remarked that at least the villagers had some hope, and if they had gone to Kresk, they would have perished in meer days in the forest.
