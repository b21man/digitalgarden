#### recap 
The session opened mid-air—locked in battle with a monstrous, winged Strix. Three swarms followed from the forest, shrieking wooden terror. The fight was brutal but brief. Enya ended it in a storm of flame, shattering the creature with nearly 90 points of blazing wrath.

As the smoke cleared, they passed through an eerie, unmarked graveyard. On the gallows, a swaying corpse bore Azurite’s face—though none but he could see it.

At the Vistani camp, the party reunited with Stanimir—whom they had once met outside Daggerford. He urged them to meet Madame Eva. Within her tent, the old seer gave each a cryptic title, hinting at their hidden natures. She warned of a spy among them.

Silas caught an eavesdropper—Dalia, a Vistani dancer from before. Enya demanded a personal reading: their stars spoke of strife, love, and rule. They gathered by the fire, told tales, and conned each other in good humor—until it was time to leave.

But Dalia followed.

The party cast _Sleep_, bound her, gagged her, and stuffed her ears with mud. On the road, they passed a spectral procession—ghostly souls walking solemnly toward Castle Ravenloft, a reminder of those who had failed.

Under the full moon, Kaelin wrestled with his curse, and mastered it.

Madame Eva revealed their fates: ancient foes, lost souls, treasures in dens of outcasts, weapons behind amber doors, allies near Saint Markovia’s abbey, and the dark heart of the castle itself.

But as they released Dalia, Silas let something slip. Her eyes lit with realization. Panic spread.

Words failed. Intimidation failed.  
So—Enya silenced her. They cut out her tongue. She screamed.

The party argued. Then Enya, calm and cold, ended her life. Apa carried the body back to the graves, digging silently beneath Madame Eva’s disappointed gaze.

They returned, bloodied and silent, to the camp—washed and worn—sleep taking them in a world more fragile than ever.
