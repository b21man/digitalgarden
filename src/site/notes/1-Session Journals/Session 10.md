#### Recap; 
Last time, after Rictavio's tale faded into the tavern's smoke, whispers of Baron Vallakovich stirred tension in the air. A drunken comment nearly silenced the room—and Szoldar's friend knew to hush him quick.

That night, Azurite dreamed: Strahd offered to cure his lycanthropy... if he'd invite him into Vallaki. Azurite refused—and awoke in a nightmare, the party dead, Apa screaming, “You monster!”

In the morning, unrest simmered. Rictavio received a parcel marked _Zero_. Our raven-tailed ally took wing to follow him. But fate found us first.

On the streets, the Baron’s coat was sullied by a townsfolk’s stumble. He ordered her arrest. Enya intervened; Azurite stalked through the crowd. Words turned to threats, and then—steel. Azurite struck, the Baron’s head thudding beside Enya in the mud.

Then came Izek. A demon-armed juggernaut who dropped Azurite, again and again. The party fought valiantly, felling guards. Enya rallied peasants. But Izek’s axe ended it.

Bleeding out, Azurite whispered, “Strahd Von Zarovich… I invite you in.”

Strahd _answered_. Vallaki fell in moments. Vampires, ghouls, terror in the streets.

And Azurite... closed the door behind them, sealing them in with what they’d unleashed.
