# Session Overview

5 of the party members travelled down the rickerty staircase down into the depths of the durst manor basement. Phoebe and reid stayed upstairs to look after the children's spirits.

drawn by a mysterious chanting in the distance, the party explored the jumble of tunnels and rooms. Finding crypts marked for each of the durst family, a lunch room with rotten flesh attached to yellowing bones. There was a horrible tentacled creature in a pantry, after dispatching of this creature, they split up, 2 of the party members wanted to jump heroicly over a pit around 5ft deep. Azurite the goliath managed the jump with easy, and Silas the smaller kenku rouge got creative by pole vaulting the drop. 

The others however got ambushed by ghouls garbed in worn cultish garments. As they fought the ghouls repeated "we are perfect" "we will live forever" and other such phrases. 

Chasing the ghouls down they ran into a room with a strange statue of  a gaunt, pale-faced man in a voluminous black cloak, with a wolf beside him. The man's left hand rests on the wolf's head; his right hand held a smoky-gray crystal orb. The statue's gaze has a cold, cruel glint. Enya approached the orb her shadow warping as she got closer,  as her hand touched the stone images flashed before her eyes, almost too quick to remember, A castle perched upon a rocky cliff, 3 women laughing gleefully over a smoking pot with a 4th in the background, A dark cavern set in a snowy mountain top, an Abbey upon a hill surrounded by a still town, and finally a cold beady eye staring back into her soul. 

Whilst this was happening the others noticed the shadows along the wall began to lurch and stagger towards the sorceror, quickly Enya retracted her hand and the shadows settled back as normal. 

They found the final ghoul in quaters that looked to be better kept than the rest of the dungeon, apart from the smell. They found that the smell was coming from a trunk at the centre of the bead, opening it slowly Azurite was horrified to see the flayed skin of Gustav durst. the skin, animated, began to unfurl and lunged at him, but with quick thinking he over powered the creature and shoved it into his backpack. 

finally descending further into the dungeon towards the chanting they found a room filled with odd artefacts, A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin’s hand) on a loop of rope, A knife carved from a human bone, A dagger with a rat’s skull set into the pommel etc. Deciding these were nothing more than creepy trinkets they continued into a large room blocked by a portcullis, Silas propped open the lever with his dagger, knowing that the dagger may not hold for long, as they entered the strange half flooded room the chanting, that they could now understand as 'he is ancient he is the land' suddenly stopped.

An octagnal podium raised from the water in the middle, on the podium a writihing mass of tentacles and teeth writhed, beneath in blood was written "feed him". Silas cut open his hand, poured blood into the mass which seemed to do nothing more than stir a black mass in the corner of the room. 

Azurite got the still wriggling skin of Gustav durst out of his bag and placed it onto the tentacles. they snatched the offering and dragged it back to the angulating shape . with a displeased roar it began to crawl into the light, they could now see a creature of bone and sinew, great clawed tentacles writhed. 

During the fight several of the characters were downed, another 2 were absorbed by the mound. Luckily Azurite remembered the amber shard he found in Lady dursts room, holding it aloft he shouted "RELEASE WALTER", the blob released without a thought. 

they whittled down the creature, but when they thought they had defeated the creature it attacked with renewed energy. this time letting out blood curdling screams, and spewing viscous blood. Enya spotting a gap through the tentacles saw at the centre of the creature a baby. seeing her chance she channelled a fire bolt that struck the centre. The smell of burnt flesh filled the chamber as the monster whined until the end. 

there was calm but only for a second. A angry scream eminated from the walls around them, the house began to shake, rocks started to fall. a womans voice could be heard "HOW DARE YOU KILL MY PET, YOU WILL PAY". 


#### recap 
The party descended the creaking staircase into the shadowy depths of the Durst manor basement, leaving Phoebe and Reid upstairs to watch over the children’s spirits.

Drawn by an eerie chant, they ventured through crypts marked with the Durst family name, a decayed dining hall with rotting remains, and a pantry housing a grotesque tentacled creature. After slaying it, the group split up. Azurite, the goliath, easily leaped a shallow pit, while Silas, the kenku rogue, cleverly pole-vaulted across.

Elsewhere, the others were ambushed by ghouls draped in tattered cult robes, whispering unsettling phrases like, _“We are perfect,”_ and _“We will live forever.”_ Pursuing the creatures, they discovered a cold statue of a pale man in a black cloak, holding a smoky orb. Enya approached, and as her hand touched the orb, visions assaulted her: a cliffside castle, cackling women over a cauldron, a snowy mountain cavern, and a cold, staring eye. Shadows shifted around her until she withdrew, breaking the spell.

In better-kept quarters, they found a trunk reeking of decay. Inside was Gustav Durst’s flayed, animated skin. It lunged at Azurite, but he subdued it and stashed it away. Deeper in the dungeon, they discovered grisly trinkets—bone knives, mummified hands—but pressed on to a room blocked by a portcullis. Silas propped it open with a dagger, risking its collapse.

Inside, a half-flooded chamber housed a mass of writhing tentacles atop a podium, with _“FEED HIM”_ written in blood. Silas offered his own blood, but when Azurite presented Gustav’s cursed skin, the creature consumed it greedily, revealing a monstrous form of bone and sinew.

The battle was brutal. Several fell, and two were consumed before Azurite invoked an amber shard, commanding, _“RELEASE WALTER!”_ The creature hesitated, allowing the party to attack. Finally, Enya spotted a baby at the core of the beast. A precise fire bolt struck true, burning its heart. With a final, agonized wail, the creature collapsed.

Silence fell, but the house began to tremble. A woman’s voice, shrill with fury, echoed around them: _“HOW DARE YOU KILL MY PET! YOU WILL PAY!”_ The manor quaked as rocks fell, and the party fled, their survival uncertain.
