# Session Overview 
The party was held up by bandits, one of the bandits threw reids prayer book on the muddy floor whilst rummaging in his pockets. The fighting started as Terry was able to fire blast the bandits, reducing two of them to ash. 

Fighting began, leaning heavily towards the players favour at first. Some bandits were able to start a fire under the carriage with fireworks in, but the players were able to snuff it out. they managed to kill the bandit captain with only 2 of them going down. 

however from the woods a werewolf charged in, the party attempted to escape, and succeeded, though Reid got bit and is now cursed with lycanthropy, set to go off in 6 days. 

One of the NPCs, one Marcus Williams, gave them each 50gp for saving him. the mother and child NPC were thankful too but couldn't pay anything, and the farmer stayed silent. 

they entered brackenveil, but failed to get any rooms in the nightmares bridle. Terry met marcus wife, unkown to him at the time, who refused to give up there seat after an intimidation check. so terry stood next to an orc fighter, got chatting and managed to stay in his room for the night with the orcs brother. (the orcs sleeping on the floor.) orcs called grognac and Srognac. Terry also found out her husband was seen heading towards durst manor with a pretty woman. 

In the morning they went shopping, Dan found a silver  quarter staff in the black market. They bought a few potions, no of the magical wares were intresting, terry bought some grease. Reid went to the library to learn more about his lycanthropy and learnt maybe the Vistani would be able to help him?

Mean while dan was investigating the poster board and found multiple wanted kids posters, the one he zoned in on was a Chloe williams, as the reward was very high. They asked around for the contact information and found out that it was Marcus and his wife Jolies daughter, who was kidnapped over 4 weeks ago. 

They were delighted to have company, slightly old racist, money was a fast food chain called Jobbie Jols. Does vegetarian wraps, with stickers that when peeled have prizes under! currently 14 restraunts  up and down sword coast! 

Dan investigated the daughters room over the course of a 45 minutes and found a torn bit of yellow cloth. Piecing the two together, vistani wear bright colours, they successfully deduct it could be the vistana. with the help of the gnome maid who Shauns character could speak with. 

#### recap 
While traveling, the party was ambushed by bandits. In the scuffle, one disrespectfully tossed Reid’s prayer book into the mud, prompting a swift retaliation. Terry opened with a devastating fire blast, instantly turning two bandits to ash. The fight began decisively in the party’s favor. Though the bandits lit a fire beneath the carriage carrying fireworks, the players snuffed it out. The bandit captain was slain, and only two players were briefly downed.

However, from the treeline, a werewolf charged into the fray. The party managed to escape, but not without cost—Reid was bitten, now cursed with lycanthropy set to trigger in six days.

One of the rescued NPCs, Marcus Williams, rewarded each player with 50 gold. A mother and child were grateful but penniless, and a quiet farmer offered nothing.

Arriving in Brackenveil, the party failed to secure rooms at the Nightmare’s Bridle inn. Terry unknowingly met Marcus’s wife Jolie, who refused to give up her seat. He instead roomed with two friendly orcs, Grognac and Srognac. From them, he learned Marcus had last been seen heading toward Durst Manor with a mysterious woman.

The next morning brought shopping. Dan bought a silver quarterstaff from the black market. Reid researched lycanthropy and discovered the Vistani might hold answers. Dan found a wanted poster for a missing child—Chloe Williams—with a large reward. The child’s parents were Marcus and Jolie, who run the fast-food chain _Jobbie Jols_, famous for veggie wraps and sticker-prize promos.

Investigating Chloe’s room, Dan found a scrap of yellow cloth. With help from a gnome maid, the party deduced a link to the Vistani.
