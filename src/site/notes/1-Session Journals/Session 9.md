#### recap 
The session began in blood and fury—Azurite fell beneath a werewolf and its pack, torn down in moments. All hope seemed lost… until Lily hurled her emerald gem, unleashing a titanic T-Rex. In 12 blistering seconds, the beast was crushed, then scorched to ash by Enya’s magic.

The party pressed on to Vallaki, where a sea of refugees waited in vain. Enya swayed the guards, and the group entered unchallenged. At the inn, a smoky stranger greeted them, and their raven ally led the way inside. There, over warm food, they met their hosts—and heard Rictavio’s tale begin.
