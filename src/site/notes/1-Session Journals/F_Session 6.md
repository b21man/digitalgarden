#### recap
The last zombie fell to your blades, its lifeless body crumpling at Ismark’s feet. As the dust settled, a **tall dusk elf** emerged, his presence suffused with an aura of screams. He read a proclamation declaring the siege over and the villagers spared, his tone dripping with mockery as he congratulated Ismark on his “loss.” Fear gripped the party, and you fled back to the mansion, only to find **Kolyan**, Ismark’s father, struck dead, and **Ireena** bitten by a vampyr. The weight of Barovia’s curse pressed heavier upon you.

That night, you rested in the burgomaster’s house, the air thick with tension as Ireena and Ismark’s heated argument echoed through the halls. Morning brought the grim task of carrying Kolyan’s coffin to the local church. As you searched the dead, you found a **page ripped from a book**, its script written in a strange, foreign language. Inside the church, Apa discovered **Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft**, a tome filled with cryptic knowledge about all things gothic, though much of it remained indecipherable.

The priest, **Donnavich**, lamented his inability to perform holy rites without his missing pendant. His sorrow was interrupted by a scream from below—**Doru**, his son, had returned. Descending into the underloft, you found Doru transformed into a **vampire spawn**, though his soul remained intact. He revealed that **Van Richten** was in Barovia, the very reason Doru had led the rebellion. In gratitude for your kindness, Doru directed you to a **hidden cache of treasures** before you performed the funeral rites and bid heartfelt goodbyes.

Leaving the church, you made a brief stop at Ireena’s request to gather her personal belongings. On the road, you encountered scouts searching for the **Lansten family**, only to find them moments later as **walking zombies**. Choosing stealth over confrontation, you let the undead pass and searched for the cache Doru had mentioned. Silas, ever the puzzle-solver, unlocked the chest to reveal its treasures: **three gems**—a ruby, opal, and emerald—**needled braces**, a **barbed javelin**, an **ebony arrow**, and a **lantern housing a blue spirit**.

Continuing your journey, you reached a crossroads. Turning right, you were met by a **black carriage**, from which **Strahd von Zarovich** himself emerged. The vampire lord introduced himself with chilling familiarity, addressing each of you by name and revealing knowledge he should not have possessed. He made promises: to **Enya**, he vowed to find her husband in exchange for bringing Ireena to his castle; to **Silas**, he offered the gift of true flight, though his price remained unspoken. **Azurite**, however, tested Strahd’s patience with his rudeness, earning a swift and humiliating punishment—a flick of Strahd’s wrist sent him upside down, begging for mercy.

As Strahd departed, Enya searched for the **blue-tipped raven** that had been watching over you. Instead of the raven, she heard a pained squawk and found the creature dying on the ground. From the shadows, a **giant wooden scarecrow-like crow** descended, its wingtips tipped with silvered darts. The creature attacked, its movements unnaturally swift, and the party braced for battle—****
