# Session Overview
The players started by heading over to the guards house to learn more about the vistani and connection to the missing children, where they met Aldric, a farmer who swore he'd seen a woman in the Durst manors window. The guards laughed this off, though the players took great interested. The players then interviewed the guards, finding out that they had infact been charmed by the vistani. 

Concerned they sneaked over to the vistani camp. Dan went undetected and headed over to the caravan not with the other caravans, there he found Kico, the werewolf that had attacked him the other night. Terry controlled the bonfire, distorting it into the face of the missing child. Whilst a little disturbed by this, the vistani soon recovered as stanmir cast his own control flames and soothed the fire. This action however ultimately got them caught snooping.

The vistani were pleasant enough to them, Apa and Silas joined them for some dancing, ending in both of them being charmed during the dance. Apas dancer was name Dalia. Stanmir told the rest of the players a story, though lily tried to charm him, in return he used suggestion to force her to sit by his side. Stanamir told them the story, which explained why they were so friendly with strangers. 

In the conversations the players seemed to believe that the vistani had not been stealing children, stanamir directed them towards the durst manor, so off they went to explore. 

Entering the manor they were locked inside with a bloody message on the wall stating they only had 6 hours to satiate the beast at the bottom of this dwelling. 

Exploring they encounters some spooky stuff, stuffed wolves that moved by them self, 1 wolf they tore apart, 1 they lit on fire, and the 3rd they left alone. A table of rotting food that appeared pristine, mirrors with terrifying vestiges, and more. slowly they began to piece together the truth about what happened in this awful manor. they found the husbands body, flayed and hanging, animated armor that almost killed  the nurse maids body, mutiliated and borken. Lastly they found two of the 3 durst children, Rose and Thorn. 

They explained to the party the awful goings on, and the partys they used to have in the basements. Just as the adventurers embarked down the twisting stairs downwards, Terry promised that he'd lay the nurse maids body, and the two child bodys to rest somewhere out of the house.


#### recap 
The party began by visiting the guardhouse to investigate the Vistani’s ties to the missing children. There, they met Aldric, a shaken farmer claiming he'd seen a woman in the Durst Manor window. The guards dismissed him, but the party took interest. Questioning the guards revealed they’d been magically charmed by the Vistani.

Troubled, they crept toward the Vistani camp. Dan snuck to a lone caravan, where he found Kico—the werewolf who had attacked him previously. At the main fire, Terry distorted the flames into the face of the missing child, unnerving the Vistani. Stanmir countered with his own spell, calming the group—but the party’s cover was blown.

Despite this, the Vistani were welcoming. Apa and Silas joined a lively dance, only to be charmed mid-routine. Apa’s partner introduced herself as Dalia. Meanwhile, Lily tried to charm Stanmir but was instead magically _suggested_ to sit beside him. Stanmir told a tale justifying their openness with strangers. Convinced the Vistani weren't behind the disappearances, the party followed Stanmir’s lead to the Durst Manor.

Inside, the door sealed shut behind them. A blood-scrawled warning appeared: **“Six hours to feed the beast below.”**

They began exploring, encountering haunted illusions—stuffed wolves that moved, one burned, one torn, one left alone. A pristine feast that rotted upon touch. Shifting mirrors, spectral figures. They uncovered the flayed corpse of the husband, and a deadly animated armor.

They finally found the bodies of Rose and Thorn, two of the Durst children, who revealed the manor’s awful truth. As the group descended deeper into the manor, Terry promised to lay the dead—nursemaid and children—to rest outside.
